**Description**

This is a project for software principles, where I need to create an application to allow a CV input and then display a ranked list based on the ranking of CV strength, which is evaluated with Stanford NLP usage. Although a UI
wasn't needed as part of the requirements, I have implemented such.

**Git Cloning**

Clone this repository by using:
- 'git clone https://github.com/Landeryou05/CVAnalyser.git'

**Dependancies**

For this application to work, StanfordCoreNLP needs to be installed at:
- https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/
This is because of the git individual push limit, where it is set to 100MB and LFS is not practical for this project.
